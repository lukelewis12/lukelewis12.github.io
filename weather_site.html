        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <p>
                The purpose of <i>The Weather Site</i> is to
                give current weather conditions in 3 different ways.
                The initial page will give the weather for the 
                current location based on the Geocoding location 
                information from the device.  The second is weather
                for 3 specific locations accessible through a 
                dedicated link, and the third is weather for 
                any location determined by a search string.
        </p>
    
        <h2>Audience</h2>
        <p>
            Primary audience is adults ages 18-30.  Most will be
            students.  Access to the site will be split between 
            mobile devices and laptops. A secondary audience will
            be anyone interested in weather.</p>
    

        <h3>Audience Goals</h3>
        <p>
                College students move around quite a bit so one
                goal would be to quickly get the weather conditions
                for their current location as they head off to class
                or study. They are also often far from their homes
                so the ability to quickly get the conditions for a
                specific location is important as well.  The third 
                goal deals with planning for travels...the ability to
                get weather conditions for any location will help with
                last minute packing for road trips.
        </p>

        <h3>Persona</h3>
        <img src= "/images/plan-images/cool-joe.jpg" alt= "Joe Cool">
        <ul>
            <li><b>Name:</b> Joe Cool</li>
            <li><b>Occupation:</b> Student</li>
            <li><b>Age:</b> Eternally 18</li>
            <li><b>Interests:</b> Traveling, Flying, Play Acting, Eating</li>
            <li><b>Motivation:</b> Joe is not into planning. His last
                    minute scrambling, whether it is getting to class
                    in the morning or heading out on his latest adventure,
                    has ledt him unprepared for the weather conditions many
                    times (He is tired of sleeping in the rain and snow).
                    He would like to be more prepared... without having
                    to put much effort into it... or planning.</li>
            <li><b>Environment:</b> Joe is comfortable using laptops and
                    mobile devices, he will most often be found on a 
                    smartphone however. Many of the places he frequents
                    do not have great signal... he is often dealing
                    with 3G speeds.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Content</h2>
        <p>
            All weather pages should include location name, current temperature,
            forecast high, forecast low, current weather descriptor, forecast
            percentage of precipitation, and current wind speed and direction
            on small devices and hourly temps shoud be added on larger screens.
            The pages of the <i>Weather Site</i> will be built in the following
            order:
        </p>

        <h3>Pages</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Franklin and Greenville</b> weather for each specific location
                    The weather for these pages should be pulled from the weather, 
                    JSON file that will be provided.</li>
            <li><b>Current:</b> weather for the current location. Current location
                    Current location should be determined by using the geolocation
                    API of the browser. This information should be passed to the 
                    National Weather Service (NWS) API to retrieve the current 
                    conditions.</li>
            <li><b>Search:</b> Begins with only a search box, characters entered will
                    cause a list of suggested matches to appear. Selected location
                    will pull up the weather.</li>
